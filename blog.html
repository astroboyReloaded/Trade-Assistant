            To calculate the size of a trading position, we need 4 pieces of
            data: entry piece, stop loss, account balance and risk percentage;
            if we also want to know the potential profit amount, we’ll need a
            take profit price as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Place the data in the corresponding fields and click on the “SIZE”
            button to get back key risk-management data for your trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            Position size is the amount of money we’ll need to invest in that
            specific trade so that, if the price moves from the entry price to
            the stop loss price, we would only loose exactly the amount we were
            willing to risk for that trade, which is determined by the risk
            percentage and the balance we entered in the calculator. The
            position size is displayed with 8 decimals to allow position sizes
            to be calculated in any currency (including all cryptos), but there
            is no need to worry if your trade sheet only allows fewer decimal
            digits, when you copy and paste the amount in your trading platform,
            it will consider as many digits as it can take for that particular
            asset or pair, and that’s just as accurate as it needs to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your trading risk management strategy is based on a fixed risk
            amount, simply place that amount as the balance and set the risk
            percentage to 100%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important piece of data is the leverage amount needed for
            each specific trade, since the more leverage is used, the more
            interest rates are paid in for margin markets trades and more
            funding rates for futures markets trades; so, though it’s not a
            difficult calculation to make, knowing the minimum amount of
            leverage needed for a trade is of considerable importance, specially
            to keep those losses under control, but also so we don’t wonder why
            our winning trades sometimes don’t quite giving us the exact amount
            we had calculated; which is why the Trade Assist Risk/Reward
            Calculator includes this piece of data for you to include in your
            trading risk management strategy . All though these elements usually
            represent a smaller portion of transaction costs if leverage is kept
            low, it’s a good idea to be aware of the rates that your platform
            charges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, keep in mind that there are other factors that can make the
            resulting amount of a trade differ from the calculation, such as
            trading fees (it’s usually best to place limit orders than market
            orders to keep this costs in the lower interval) and slippage
            (something that should not be of concern if you are just starting to
            trade or are still developing your strategy, since you are supposed
            to be trading smaller amounts until you become a consistent
            profitable trader; but can become a major factor when we start
            trading larger amounts, in such case we must have good understanding
            of what market depth is and how order books work).
          </p>
          <p>
            But that’s not all we must consider in our risk management strategy
            to efficiently maximize profits and minimize losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing the risk/reward ratio and the potential profit amount that a
            trade can gain us is the other half of the equation!
          </p>
          <p>
            A successful trading strategy, by law of provability, requires for
            each trade to have at the verry minimum a larger thar 1:1 ratio and,
            in such case, the win-lose rate must be above 50% to barely be
            profitable. That’s why an efficient risk management strategy usually
            aims for a 1.5:1 ratio or higher, being 2:1 and 3:1 ratios the most
            commonly looked for by professional traders, but don’t close your
            mind to even higher ratios as some strategies can sometimes get us
            5:1 ratios or more if implemented properly.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, our recommendation at Trade Assist is that you always have at
            least one take profit target determined before you take any position
            (make a trade) and make sure the risk/reward ratio is on your favor,
            otherwise, one loosing trade can wipe out what you’ve made in the
            last few trades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Include your take profit target price data in the risk/reward
            calculator and get the potential profit amount, profit percentage
            (based on the balance amount) and risk/reward ratio data for that
            trade returned to you so you can make better trading decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Trade Assist app we are working to implement better tools to help
            us place more accurate trades, and implement finer strategies,
            including more position size calculation and risk management
            features aswell.
