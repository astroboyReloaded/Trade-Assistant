Development Documentation.

- The Balance Plays a different rol in the locked inputs interactivity. It does not form part of the locked stack, therefore it does not get unlocked automatically, nor it interferes with the calculations order. The only difference the lock of this input makes is weather the amounts get calculated or not wen other fields are changed. When the Balance is not locked, the 'amount' inputs calculate the Balance on change.

## Future Features:
- Tab into the History button. Open it with enter.
